# William Skrypek

Hello! I am William Skrypek, or Liam for short, and I am a high school student in the Twin Cities. I love learning and exploring new topics, and following old ones wherever they lead. I will do light biographical work here, but most of the things I publish stem from projects, notes, experiments, and ongoing personal and academic endeavors. 

*Currently the content below is proof of concept and extremely limited. The bulk of updates are to come*.
