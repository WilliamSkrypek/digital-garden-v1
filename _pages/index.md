## Colophon

The creation of this site is very complex, yet it is one of the simplestet websites you will find. I have alwyas admired the beauty in simplicity and nowadays that is getting harder and harder to come by.
This site is written and edited in Obsidian. The raw text files are automatically compiled into web pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Initially this website was based on [this template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt, however it has undergone intense changes.

I thank Maxime Vaillancourt and Steph Ango greatly for their inspiration and material.
