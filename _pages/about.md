## Colophon

This site is written and edited in Obsidian. The raw text files are automatically converted to html using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted inside of a Github repository. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) then compiles them into web pages, under my domain.

Initially this website was based on [this template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt, however it has undergone heavy changes.

I thank Maxime Vaillancourt and Steph Ango greatly for their inspiration and content.
