# William Skrypek
Hello! I am William Skrypek, or Liam for short, and I am a high school student in Minnesota. I have many vocations; find out what I am working on currently in the below section:

## Colophon
The creation of this site is very complex, yet likely more minimal than any other websites you will find. I have always admired the beauty in simplicity, however nowadays that is getting harder and harder to come by. To achieve this look I had to learn a lot of things.

This site is written and edited in Obsidian. Then, with the help of Ruby and Ruby Gems, the raw text files are automatically compiled into web pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted inside of a Github repository. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) then puts the pages into website form, under my domain.

Initially this website was based on [this template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt, however it has undergone intense changes.

I thank Maxime Vaillancourt and Steph Ango greatly for their inspiration and material.
